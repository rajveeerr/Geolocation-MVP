## üì± Responsive Behavior

All hero sections are fully responsive:
- **Mobile:** Stacked layout with smaller text
- **Tablet:** Medium sizing with proper spacing
- **Desktop:** Full-size layout with optimal spacing
- **Large screens:** Centered with max-width constraints

The 3-line heading structure works well across all screen sizes, with icons scaling appropriately and text wrapping gracefully on smaller screens.
